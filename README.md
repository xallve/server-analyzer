# server-analyzer
Analysis and prediction of unhealthy traffic on a web server

the project involves analyzing web server logs to identify traffic anomalies using PySpark and machine learning. We will analyze 3.5 GB of Nginx logs to identify anomalies, such as possible DDoS attacks or unusual request patterns, and visualize the results through the Flask web interface.
